There may be some circumstances in a troubleshooting scenario where you are advised to '**Reset your BIOS**' to see if that resolves your issue.

## What is your BIOS?

**B**asic **I**nput **O**utput **S**ystem

The BIOS is the preinstalled firmware that is loaded onto a small memory chip of the motherboard of a computer. It is the software responsible for the hardware initialisation during booting and to provide runtime services for the launch of the operating system and programs. It is completely independent of the operating system and is _non volatile_, meaning that it survives in the event that all power is removed from the device.

## Why Reset your BIOS?

Often there can be small issues caused by actions made since the factory install. By resetting the BIOS it restores the Avado to the default factory settings that were designed for everything to function optimally. It can often be all that is needed to resolve a problem.

## How do I Reset My BIOS?

Resetting the BIOS is as simple as removing the _CMOS\*_ Battery from within the Avado for several minutes and then replacing it.

Please carefully follow the steps below.

\*CMOS (Pronounced "see-moss") - **C**omplementary **M**etal-**O**xide-**S**emiconductor - A small battery powered memory chip responsible for holding basic information for the BIOS.

### STEP ONE

**Unplug the Avado** and place it in a clear work area face down flat with screws on the topside.

### STEP TWO

!! Ground yourself. !!

You must discharge any static electricity buildup you may have on your body before you start doing anything inside your Avado.

Static electricity can damage the delicate inner workings of computers.

### STEP THREE

Unscrew the 6Â phillips head screws on the base of the Avado to remove the bottom plate.

Place them somewhere they won't be lost. You'll need them again in literally 3 minutes.

### STEP FOUR

Locate the CMOS Battery. It is the small silver 3V Lithium Battery that looks like this.

_**Note: In the i3, i5 and HOPR Avado Models the CMOS Battery is located under the RAM.**_

### STEP FIVE

Using a small flat head screw driver gently insert it into the "U" shaped side of the battery seat and slowly lift the Lithium battery out from its pocket.

Take the battery out for 2 minutes.

Then:

*   Replace the battery gently
*   Close the box up by reinserting the 6 screws
