## What is Mysterium

The Mysterium package turns your AVADO box into a VPN endpoint. VPN traffic is provided by the Mysterium Network. You can earn crypto by renting out your spare internet bandwidth at home.

_The fabric of an interconnected, open and democratic internet is tearing apart in the hands of corporations and governments. We are reinventing the web so that it becomes safe, accessible and private by default. As a grassroots and community-driven project, you are quite literally what powers our network._

_How are we doing this? We are building: **A global decentralised network of residential IPs who are incentivised**._
