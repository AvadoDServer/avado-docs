This page will describe how to stake ETH with Stader on your Avado.

## Stader

Stader is a decentralized staking pool for Ethereum that allows you to start staking with as little as 4 ETH.
You will earn ETH and SD tokens by running a Stader validator.

## Demo video 

Here is a Youtube tutorial on how to create your validator. The video still gives a good overview of the process in general. (It does not contain the cashback which is explained below)

## ETHx Validator Cashbask Action (NEW!)

Together with Stader - we are giving away free SD tokens for each validator you set up.

To claim a single validator go to the "Claim Rewards" tab

Then you will see a list of your validators - check the agree checkbox and then you can submit a claim for eah of your validators.

After a few seconds the button will disappear and a confirmation message will appear. Your SD tokens will be automatically paid out after some time (we will batch payouts and notify everyone in the stader discord channel)
