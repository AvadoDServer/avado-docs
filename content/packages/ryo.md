## What is RYO Cloud (aka Run You Own Cloud)?

The AVADO RYO (Run Your Own) Cloud is a revolutionary way to share your AVADO resources with others.  
  
We pool together many AVADO devices and create new networks of decentralized nodes that provide valuable services to others.  
Many of these pools are already live:

*   Ethereum RPC node pool
*   IPFS gateway pool
*   The Tornado Cash relayer pool
*   and several more...

### Why?

Become part of a RYO cloud pool and get rewarded for participating through trustless Smart Contract based incentives.

## Setting up “RYO Cloud"

By running the “RYO Client” you'll become member of the “RYO Cloud"-family

How to install and run it:

1.  Go to: “DAppsstore”
2.  Select: “RYO Client”
3.  Click the “INSTALL”-button
4.  Wait (a bit)  
    Let the installer do the work.
5.  Activate the resources that can be shared.  
    Share your resources and earn crypto. Together we are powering the web3 with IPFS and Ethereum endpoints.  
    After it's installed go to the configure page where you will see a list of all services running on your AVADO that you can share through the AVADO RYO Cloud.  
    Select the packages you want to share in the AVADO RYO Cloud.
6.  Name your node (optional)
7.  To which Ethereum address should ava.do send your rewards  
    Paste your ETH-payment address  
    Tip: you can create a new one in your metamask
8.  Click: “Save and start package”.
9.  You're all set!

### Double check

To verify that your packages work, go to the AVADO RYO Cloud status page and verify that your machine name shows up in the list.

It should appear within one minute after starting the RYO Client.
