We take user support very seriously and want you to have a good experience setting up your device.
Unfortunately we experienced a lot of scammers attacking our community and we.decided to move away from Telegram.

Please reach out to our dedicated support community on Discord: https://discord.gg/wAKPBjFzaB
It’s available 24/7 and it’s experienced users giving solutions on your problems. Most of the problems have already occurred and the solutions are available. Community members get paid for giving support and even you can give support to others and earn some xDAI. AVADO helps in all areas to earn crypto.
