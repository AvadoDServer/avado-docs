{{< hint type=warning title="A word of warning for first-time Telegram users" >}}
Our telegram groups are open to everyone. As much as we try to keep them out, scammers might occasionally be looking for a victim in our channels. With these simple rules you can protect yourself: 
- Try to talk in public channels as much as possible
- Never repond to Direct Messages (DM's) sent to you
- Our telegram members will not Direct Message (DM) you first.
- In Telegram it's easy to impersonate someone. Check that you are talking to the same person

Signs that you're talking to a scammer:
- They will reach out to you directy using a direct Message (DM) and offer "assistance"
- They will send you to a website and try to have you enter private information, like a private key or a seed phrase ("verify your wallet" or "bridge your wallet" .. etc )

If you come across scammers - please expose them in our public channels to help others !

The good news is that apart from the occasional scammer - our channels are full with people that want to actually help you ðŸ˜€
