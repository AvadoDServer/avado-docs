A step by step guide on how to join the Avado discord:

## Step 1

Mint your NFT on <https://nft.ava.do> using the email you ordered from. In case you get an error message you can fill out this form to receive help with your minting process.

*Why is the Avado discord tokengated with an NFT? To prevent scammers from joining. So always keep discussions in public channels on our discord to stay safe.*

Go to: <https://nft.ava.do> connect your wallet and sign the minting transaction.

## Step 2

Join the discord and verify your NFT following the instruction in the `#collabland-join` channel. 

[Join Discord]({{< discord >}})  

## Step 3

You will be asked to verify using collabland. [Insert photos and collabland process] 

After verifying you now have access to the community-channels

The button will create a custom link that is valid for 5 minutes. It takes you to the Collabland website where you have to choose the wallet you minted the Avado NFT from.

## Step 3

After connecting your wallet to the site you will be asked to sign the message to verify you own an Avado NFT.

If you did within the 5 minutes, you will see this screen and can return to the Avado discord server where you should now see all channels and have full access.

## What to do if your signing failed

If you get an error message like “Signing failed” then you have to go back to the #collabland-join channel on the Avado discord and click on “connect wallet” again to create a new link because the old one most likely expired after 5 mins. 

If that was not the problem please open a ticket on discord and we will look into it.
