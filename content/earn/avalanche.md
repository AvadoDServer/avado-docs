Avalanche is built by [Avalabs](https://www.avalabs.org/why-avalanche).

## Why?

1.  Stake your crypto to earn rewards (Proof Of Stake Blockchain nodes)
2.  Developers who build on Avalanche can easily create **powerful**, **reliable**, and **secure** **applications** and **custom blockchain networks** with complex rulesets or build on existing private or public subnets.

## Who?

You can use the Avado all-in-one package when:
- you want to stake AVAX tokens as a **delegator** or a **validator**
- you want to run an Avalanche Node
- use the Avalanche web wallet

### Financials

You'll need a minimum of **2000 AVAX** tokens to start a validator. [Current value](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/).Â 

If you do have some AVAX tokens (minimum 25 AVAX tokens), but less than the required minimum of 2000, you can alwasy delegate these tokens to an existing validator with this same package. Contact that trusted party.
