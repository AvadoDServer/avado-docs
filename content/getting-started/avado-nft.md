But, we recognized more use cases of NFT‘s than to store digital art.

So even though an AVADO device is not a piece of art (though close enough ;-) ), we have created an AVADO NFT with information about the device and the exact time of purchase.

## Introduction

**An AVADO NFT is a unique identifier**, showing that the holder of the NFT has an AVADO device.

It shows when it was bought and what device it represents, but it does not reveal any information about the person owning it.

We care about privacy but also need to be able to identify that the user has bought our device. We’re solving this difficult problem by using NFTs.

### **What are the use cases for AVADO NFT?**

1.  Warranty
2.  Support
3.  Token Drops

> _“The AVADO NFT makes your device unique. Once you claim it, you have digital proof of ownership of an AVADO device in your account. Many use cases we foresee make this NFT very useful and valuable. Keep it safe! And we’ll keep you updated on new functionalities of your AVADO NFT.”_  
> _\- Stefaan Ponnet_

## Warranty

First of all, each NFT identifies that the owner has bought an AVADO. This is important if you want to claim the warranty for the device. With the info from the NFT, we know exactly what AVADO device the user has and when it was purchased. We can check if the warranty is still valid without having to keep user data in our database. IPFS and blockchain are our sources of information.

## Support

We have a community-driven support system, and NFTs can even increase the utility of it.

Using NFTs, we can allocate a support budget to each device. Device owners who ask for support will have a specific budget available (based on the device they bought) to use to “dish praise” to AVADO community members who helped them resolve an issue.

We will also use the NFT to ensure that only users who have an AVADO will receive the praise, so the support budget is kept within the AVADO community.

We can use NFTs to automate this process: our Support Genie “Avaddin” will not only count the praise a user received but will also allocate the budget to the support giver sending it to the NFT address. This will make our support even more scalable.

## Token Drops

Projects that have a DApp in the AVADO DAppstore can also use our NFTs to identify box owners. This enables them to allocate their tokens to incentivize the use of their DApp on AVADO.

### Get up to 500 HOPR tokens

HOPR is the first project to use our NFT system.  

HOPR Box customers were the first users of the HOPR network, they vested interest in the project economically before anyone else. They provided support to the network and signaled the value of the HOPR project early on.

That's why HOPR and AVADO want to thank these and future users with the following reward system:

*   Existing HOPR PC users who purchased a device (up to 300) will receive 500 HOPR tokens
*   Existing AVADO users who have purchased a device before April 1st, 2021 (up to 1000) and who run HOPR package will receive 100 HOPR tokens
*   Future AVADO users who would install the HOPR package (up to 1000) will receive 50 HOPR tokens

To identify these users, HOPR will look for the NFT tokens, including metadata that distinguishes between:

* HOPR PC and AVADO devices
* The date of purchase for each device

### How to claim AVADO NFT?

Every AVADO owner, no matter if you purchased the device in 2018 or today, can go to [NFT.AVA.DO](https://nft.ava.do/) and mint their token. Your e-mail address will be used to start the process, and you should have Metamask enabled in your browser.

FAQ

Is the NFT on xDai?  
\> Yes

Just minted my AVADO NFT token. Is there any way to view this on my MetaMask wallet?  
\> [https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-See-Your-Tokens-and-Custom-Tokens-in-Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-See-Your-Tokens-and-Custom-Tokens-in-Metamask)

I can't Mint my NFT. It says that my email was not found although I use the exact same one that I used for my purchase.  
\> Attention: e-mail address is case sensitive.  
\> Your NFT is not available before you receive your device and even some time after. Contact saskia@ava.do if you cannot access the NFT
