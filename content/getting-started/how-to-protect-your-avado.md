# How to protect your AVADO for Optimal Use & a Longer Lifespan

Your AVADO is a high performance piece of computer hardware specifically designed and optimised for blockchain use.

In order to get the best use and lifetime out of your AVADO it is strongly advised to take some simple precautions.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è POWER SURGES ‚ö°Ô∏è

Electrical current surges are an inevitable occurrence with most modern day power grids. Sudden spikes in electricity can be extremely damaging on microprocessors. Computers are filled with voltage sensitive components and your AVADO is no different.

At the very least power surges will adversely affect the lifespan of your AVADO, at worst it could corrupt pacakge data or damage the hardware.

So it is worth protecting.

Surge protection can take many forms, so you do have a few options:

- Surge Protector Power Strips: {{< figure src="surge_strip.jpeg" height="200">}}
- Socket Surge Protectors: {{< figure src="surge_socket.jpeg" height="200">}}
- UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply): {{< figure src="surge_ups.jpeg" height="200">}}

A UPS has the benefit of not only offering some protection from Power Surges, but it also can prevent disruption to your internet connection and AVADO during any power cuts.

It is for this reason that it could be seen to offer the best value for money to protect your AVADO.

Any interruption to your internet router or AVADO will disturb the performance of the packages you are running and certainly result in missed Attestations for an ETH 2.0 validator.

{{< hint type=tip >}}Remember
With every voltage fluctuation Surge Protectors absorb, their lifespan is shortened. To be sure you‚Äôre still getting optimal protection, it‚Äôs a good idea to replace them every two to three years.

## üå°Ô∏è OVERHEATING üå°Ô∏è

The AVADO i7 enclosure is a fanless design with cooling fins to enable cooling of the system. During inital sync of a blockchain the system has to work at 100% capacity for multiple hours (>24h) - so monitoring the unit's temperature is recommended  during that initial sync.

We recommend that you put the fan on top of the device with the airflow pointing downwards and plug it in any of the available USB ports to provide extra cooling during this initial sync. Feel free to leave the fan on there permanently.

AVADO is now including a free USB Fan for all i7 orders. (The R9 units come with an integrated fan and are do not require this).


This is especially important if your AVADO will be in a location with no airflow or exposed to a particularly hot climate.

The fan model above is one that has been used by other AVADO owners and is linked below if you are looking to purchase a fan:

## OTHER PRECAUTIONS

It goes without saying that you should also place your AVADO

- away from other appliances that generate heat
- out of direct sunlight
- allow sufficient clearance around the unit for air to flow freely, i.e not jammed up tight against a wall or stacked on top of other heat-generating network equipment.
