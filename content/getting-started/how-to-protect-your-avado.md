# How to protect your Avado for Optimal Use & a Longer Lifespan

Your Avado is a high performance piece of computer hardware specifically designed and optimised for blockchain use.

In order to get the best use and lifetime out of your Avado it is strongly advised to take some simple precautions.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è POWER SURGES ‚ö°Ô∏è

Electrical current surges are an inevitable occurrence with most modern day power grids. Sudden spikes in electricity can be extremely damaging on microprocessors. Computers are filled with voltage sensitive components and your Avado is no different.

At the very least power surges will adversely affect the lifespan of your Avado, at worst it could wipe all data and destroy the system.

So it is worth protecting.

Surge protection can take many forms, so you do have a few options:

- Surge Protector Power Strips: {{< figure src="surge_strip.jpeg" height="200">}}
- Socket Surge Protectors: {{< figure src="surge_socket.jpeg" height="200">}}
- UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply): {{< figure src="surge_ups.jpeg" height="200">}}

A UPS has the benefit of not only offering some protection from Power Surges, but it also can prevent disruption to your internet connection and Avado during any power cuts.

It is for this reason that it could be seen to offer the best value for money for the Avado use case.

Any interruption to your internet router or Avado will disturb the performance of the packages you are running and certainly result in missed Attestations for an ETH 2.0 validator.

Below are links to some commonly recommended UPS models used by fellow Avabros

{{< hint type=tip >}}Remember
With every voltage fluctuation Surge Protectors absorb, their lifespan is shortened. To be sure you‚Äôre still getting optimal protection, it‚Äôs a good idea to replace them every two to three years.

## üå°Ô∏è OVERHEATING üå°Ô∏è

The Avado has a fanless design with fins to enable easy cooling of the system. This does not mean that you shouldn't take care with heat exposure.

Avado is now including a free USB Fan for orders, but in case you purchased your unit earlier you are best to be investing a tiny amount in making sure your Avado does not overheat.

This is especially important if your Avado will be in a location with no airflow or exposed to a particularly hot climate.

A small USB fan similar to the one now included in orders should suffice.

The fan model above is one that has been used by other Avado owners and is linked below:

## OTHER PRECAUTIONS

It goes without saying that you should also place your Avado

- away from other appliances that generate heat
- out of direct sunlight
- with room around the unit for airflow, i.e not jammed up tight against a wall
