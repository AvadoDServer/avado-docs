Welcome to a tale of entropy, Belgian beers, and Ethereum! We, Hendrik and Stefaan, two Ethereum enthusiasts from Belgium, embarked on an unconventional journey to collect entropy for the [Ethereum KZG Ceremony](https://ceremony.ethereum.org/). Our mission was to generate randomness using video footage of randomly selected Belgian beers being poured and emptied. In this blog post, we'll share our process and the fun we had along the way.


## The Team

[Hendrik](https://twitter.com/heeckhau) and [Stefaan](https://twitter.com/sponnet) are both passionate about Ethereum. Stefaan has a long track record in Ethereum and already participated in the [Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony in 2019](https://github.com/weijiekoh/perpetualpowersoftau/tree/master/0036_stefaan_response). Both Stefaan and Hendrik have been solo staking Ethereum on Avado since the Beacon Chain Genesis.

More importantly, the team has life-long experience tasting Belgian beers. It is rumored their first tastings started before they were 12. They even have a [beer POAP](https://poap.family/event/96435)!

They are also known to be rather unpredictable, which also helps for the task at hand.

## Our Methodology

Our approach to collecting entropy was both unique and entertaining. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of our process:

1. **Get a varied set of Belgian beers.** We gathered a diverse selection of Belgian beers, ensuring that each pour would be unpredictable.
2. **Set up an Avado box with a Ubuntu Live Linux USB stick and a camera to film the beers being poured into a glass.** We used a spare [Avado i5](https://ava.do) and a camera to capture the randomness generated by pouring the beers and the carbon dioxide gas bubbles in the beers.

1. **Activate a smoke machine to ensure privacy.** To prevent any curious neighbors from witnessing our activities, we activated a smoke machine, creating a veil of secrecy.

1. **Start and stop the video stream at a random moment and pour and empty the first beers.** To ensure even more randomness, we started and stopped the video stream at completely unpredictable moments.

1. **Postprocess the entropy and contribute it to the Ethereum KZG Ceremony.** We processed the captured entropy and contributed it to the Ethereum KZG Ceremony to help secure the network.

1. **Wipe the Avado box.** After collecting the entropy, we shut down the Avado box. Because it was running a Live Distribution, this wipes all data. To be extra sure we also destroyed the USB stick and emptied the beers.

1. **Share the process on Lens and Twitter with an explanation and (censored) pictures.** We documented our adventure on Lens and Twitter, sharing our experience with the community.
2. **Empty the remaining beers.** Last but not least, we enjoyed the remaining Belgian beers as a reward for our hard work.

By following this unconventional approach, we successfully provided high-quality entropy for the Ethereum KZG Ceremony. Our journey was not only fun and memorable, but it also allowed us to enjoy some delicious Belgian beers. Most importantly, we contributed to the security and stability of the Ethereum network in a unique and entertaining way.

Cheers!
