What is AVADO?
==============

With AVADO anyone can easily run Web3 applications like **staking or** **running blockchain nodes for personal use.**

You get access through its **WiFi hotspot** or Remote Connect [**(set up)**](/tutorials/remote-connect).  
The user-friendly UI allows you to use and manage the device from anywhere in the world.

It comes pre-installed with the AVADO OS, saving you a lot of time and research setting up a node.  
  
Using an AVADO is convenient, secure and true to the spirit of decentralization.
